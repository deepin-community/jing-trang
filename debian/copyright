    This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August 14
    1998 so as to improve compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that
    W3C software licensing terms are no more restrictive than GPL and
    consequently W3C software may be distributed in GPL packages. See the
    older formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our
    Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site,
    including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya,
    and Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be directed to
